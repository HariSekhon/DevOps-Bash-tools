SQL Scripts
===========

You might also be interested in `sqlcase.pl` in the [DevOps Perl tools](https://github.com/harisekhon/devops-perl-tools) repo to autocase your SQL code (I use this a lot and call it via hotkey in the `.vimrc` at the top level)

- `aws_athena_cloudtrail_ddl.sql` - [AWS Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) DDL to setup up integration to query [CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/) logs from Athena
- `bigquery_billing_*.sql` - various [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) billing queries
