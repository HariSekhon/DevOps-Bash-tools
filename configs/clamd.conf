# When enabled, if a heuristic scan (such as phishingScan) detects
# a possible virus/phish it will stop scan immediately. Recommended, saves CPU

# at the end of a scan. If an archive contains both a heuristically detected
# virus/phish, and a real malware, the real malware will be reported.

# Max amount of time (in milliseconds) that the OnAccess client should spend for every connect, send, and receive attempt when communicating with clamd via curl (5s default)

# Max number of scanning threads to allocate to the OnAccess thread pool at startup--these threads are the ones responsible for creating a connection with the daemon and kicking off scanning after an event has been processed. To prevent clamonacc from consuming all clamd's resources keep this lower than clamd's max threads. Default is 5
# Default: 5
#OnAccessMaxThreads 10

# Number of times the OnAccess client will retry a failed scan due to connection problems (or other issues). Defaults to no retries.
# Default: 0
#OnAccessRetryAttempts 3

# When using prevention, if this option is turned on, any errors that occur during scanning will result in the event attempt being denied. This could potentially lead to unwanted system behaviour with certain configurations, so the client defaults to off and allowing access events in case of error.
