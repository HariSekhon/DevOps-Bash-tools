# Configs

Config files for various common open source software I use on
[Linux](https://github.com/HariSekhon/Knowledge-Base/blob/main/linux.md) and
[Mac](https://github.com/HariSekhon/Knowledge-Base/blob/main/mac.md).

I symlink these to my home directory using this command at the root of this repo:

```shell
make link
```

Files and directories to symlink are defined in:

[../setup/files.txt](https://github.com/HariSekhon/DevOps-Bash-tools/blob/master/setup/files.txt)
